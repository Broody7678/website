 •    Health is a state of complete physical, mental and social <br> well-being and not merely the absence of <br> disease or infirmity. <br> <br>
 •    The enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health is one of the <br>fundamental rights of every human being without distinction of race, <br> religion, political belief, economic or social condition. <br> <br>
 •    The health of all peoples is fundamental to the attainment of peace and <br> security and  is dependent on the fullest co-operation of individuals and States. <br> <br>
 •    The achievement of any State in the promotion and protection of health is of value to all.  <br> <br>
 •    Unequal development in different countries in the promotion of health and <br> control of diseases, especially communicable disease, is a common danger. <br> <br>
 •    Healthy development of the child is of basic importance; the ability to live <br> harmoniously in a changing total environment is essential to such development. <br> <br>
 •    The extension to all peoples of the benefits of medical, psychological and <br> related knowledge is essential to the fullest attainment of health. <br> <br>
 •    Informed opinion and active co-operation on the part of the public are of <br> the utmost importance in the improvement of the health of the people. <br> <br>
 •    Governments have a responsibility for the health of their peoples which can <br> be fulfilled only by the provision of adequate health and social measures.
